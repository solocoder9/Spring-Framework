ModelAndView in Spring MVC
--------------------------
- ModelAndView is a core concept in the Spring MVC that allows you to send both the model
  data and the view name from the controller to the view in a single object.
- It is a class that encapsulates both the model (data) and the view (presentation layer)
  in a single return object, making it convenient to work with both in a controller method.

■ Key Points
------------
● Why ModelAndView:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
- ModelAndView provides a convenient way to pass both the model data and the view name 
  together from the controller to the dispatcher servlet.
- It is useful when you want to explicitly return a view name along with the data (e.g., 
  when you're working wth custom views or need to provide both pieces of information 
  together).

●  How it works:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
- Create an instance of ModelAndView, add model data using the 'addObject()' method, and 
  specify the view name using the 'setViewName()' method.
