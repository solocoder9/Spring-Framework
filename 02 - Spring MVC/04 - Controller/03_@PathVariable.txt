@PathVariable in Spring MVC
---------------------------
- @PathVariable ia an annotation in Spring MVC that is used to extract values fro the URI
  (Uniform Resource Identifier) path in the URL.
- It allows you to capture variables from the URL path and bind them directly to method 
  parameters in the controller.

Key Points:
-----------
● It is used to retrieve values embedded within the URL path.
● Often used in REST APIs to extract parameters from the UrL for CRUD operations like GET,
  POST, PUT, DELETE.
● You can create dynamic URLs with placeholders that can be extracted using @PathVariable.

Example:
    // Handles requests to "/user/{id}" URL and retrieves the user with the given id
    @RequestMapping("/user/{id}")
    public String getUser(@PathVariable("id") String userId) {
        // Use the extracted userId (from the URL) to fetch user details
        System.out.println("User ID: " + userId); // For example, printing the userId
        return "user"; // Returns the user view (assuming the view name is 'user')
    }

Example Explanation:
- URL Pattern: /user/{id} is a dynamic URL where {id} is a placeholder for a variable.
- @PathVariable("id"): This extracts the value of the id variable from the URL path and 
  binds it to the method parameter userId.
- For example, if the user visits /user/123, userId will be 123.
