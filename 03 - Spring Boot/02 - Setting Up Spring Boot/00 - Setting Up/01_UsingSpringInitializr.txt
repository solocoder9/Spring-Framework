Create Spring Boot project using Spring Initializer (Website)
-------------------------------------------------------------
Step 1: Visit Spring Initializr
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
● Go to the Spring Initializr website: https://start.spring.io.

Step 2: Choose Project Settings
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
● Project: Choose Maven Project or Gradle Project depending on your preference.
● Language: Select Java.
● Spring Boot Version: Choose the latest stable version of Spring Boot.
● Project Metadata:
    ○ Group: Enter a group name, for example: com.test.
    ○ Artifact: Enter the artifact name, for example: SpringBootApp.
    ○ Name: Enter the project name.
    ○ Description: Add a description for your project.
    ○ Package Name: The package name is usually generated from the group name and artifact name, e.g., com.test.SpringBootApp.
    ○ Packaging: Choose Jar or War based on your application needs (Jar is the default for Spring Boot).
    ○ Java Version: Select the Java version you want to use (e.g., Java 11, Java 17).

Step 3: Add Dependencies
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
● Under the Dependencies section, click on Add Dependencies and select the necessary dependencies for your Spring Boot project. Some common dependencies include:
● Spring Web: For building web applications.
● Spring Boot DevTools: For live reloading and development tools.
● Spring Data JPA: If you want to use Spring Data JPA for database access.
● Thymeleaf: If you want to use Thymeleaf as a template engine for rendering web pages.
● Spring Security: If you want to secure your application.
● H2 Database (an embedded database for development and testing).

Step 4: Generate the Project
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
● Once you've selected your dependencies, click on the Generate button.
● The Spring Initializr will prepare a .zip file containing your project.
● Download the .zip file and extract it to your desired location on your machine.

Step 5: Import the Project into Your IDE
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
● Open your IDE (e.g., IntelliJ IDEA, Eclipse).
    ○ For Eclipse:
        Go to File > Import > Existing Maven Projects.
        Select the extracted project folder and click Finish.

    ○ For IntelliJ IDEA:
        Open IntelliJ IDEA and select File > Open.
        Choose the extracted project folder and click OK.

Step 6: Build and Run the Application
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
● Once your project is imported into the IDE, you can build and run the Spring Boot application.
    ○ In Eclipse:
        Right-click the Application.java (or similar class) file and select Run As > Java Application.
    ○ In IntelliJ IDEA:
        Click the Run button (the green triangle) in the top right of the IDE.
● The Spring Boot application will start, and you should see output in the console indicating that the application is running.

Step 7: Verify the Application
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
● Open your browser and go to http://localhost:8080.
● You should see a default Spring Boot message or a page based on the configurations you selected.
