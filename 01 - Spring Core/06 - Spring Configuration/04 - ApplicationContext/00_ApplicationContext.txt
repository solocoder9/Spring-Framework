ApplicationContext in Spring
----------------------------
- ApplicationContext is a central interface in the Spring Framework that provides configuration 
  and access to the Spring IoC container.
- It it responsible for instantiating, configuring, and assembling the beans defined in the 
  application.


Key Features of ApplicationContext
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
1. Bean Factory: 
    - Extends BeanFactory capabilities, providing a more advanced container with support for 
      various features like internationalization, event propagation, and declarative mechanisms 
      to create a bean.

2. Dependency Injection: 
    - Manages the lifecycle of beans and handles their dependencies through dependency injection.

3. Event Handling: 
    - Supports a powerful event handling mechanism, allowing beans to listen for and publish events.

4. Internationalization: 
    - Provides support for internationalization (i18n) through message resource handling.

5. Integration with Spring MVC: 
    - Facilitates the use of the Spring MVC framework by providing necessary configurations.


Types of ApplicationContext
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
1. ClassPathXmlApplicationContext: 
    - Loads the context definition from an XML file located in the classpath.
    - Example:
        ApplicationContext context = new ClassPathXmlApplicationContext("config.xml");

2. FileSystemXmlApplicationContext: 
    - Loads the context definition from an XML file in the filesystem.
    - Example:
        ApplicationContext context = new FileSystemXmlApplicationContext("path/to/config.xml");

3. AnnotationConfigApplicationContext: 
    - Loads the context from Java-based configuration using annotations.
    - Example:
        ApplicationContext context = new AnnotationConfigApplicationContext(AppConfig.class);
