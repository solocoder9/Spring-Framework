-----------------------------------------
● Purpose: 
    - To inject external values (like strings, numbers, or properties) directly into 
      Spring-managed beans.
● Usage: 
    - Helps in externalizing configuration, allowing you to change application behavior
      without modifying the codebase.
● Context: 
    - Part of the Spring Configuration topic, facilitating the management of application 
      properties and settings.
