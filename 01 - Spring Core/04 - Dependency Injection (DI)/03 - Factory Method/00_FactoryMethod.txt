Factory Method in Spring 
------------------------
- The Factory Method pattern in spring is a creational design pattern that allows for the 
  creation of objects (beans) without specifying the exact class that will be created.
- It promotes loose coupling and enhances flexibility in object management.

Types of Factory Methods
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
1. Static Factory Methods:
    - Defined as static method in a class.
    - useful for simple object creation without the need for an instance of the class.

2. Instance Factory Methods:
    - Defined in an instance of a class, allowing the factory to maintain state or 
      configuration.
    - Useful when more complex creation logic is needed.


Benefits
~~~~~~~~
● Separation of Concerns: Keeps the creation logic separate from the business logic.
● Flexibility: Allows for the creation of different types of objects based on configuration.
● Lazy Initialization: Can instantiate objects only when needed, improving performance.
● Testability: Simplifies testing by allowing mock objects to be created through factory methods.

Use Cases
~~~~~~~~~
● When object creation involves complex logic or external configuration.
● To manage the lifecycle of objects that require specific initialization.
● When needing to return different implementations of an interface based on conditions.
